## Help us learn about you

While you're here, we’d like to ask you a favor. We’re trying to learn more about the open source community and how Intel can best help to build an open ecosystem that’s transparent, secure, and accessible to all.

[This survey](https://evolio.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cCMUvFDzDK8bT70) is anonymous and will take about 5 minutes to complete, and is being conducted by EVOLIO Marketing, an independent 3rd party market research firm, on behalf of Intel.  For every survey completed, Intel will donate $5 to Outreachy, a program that supports diversity in free and open source software.  This survey will run through to the end of December.
